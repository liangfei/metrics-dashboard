This is just a quick hack. It works but there are a lot of improvements that needs to be done to this code.

Simple web dashboard for codahale/metrics https://github.com/codahale/metrics

This library does not require a web server or a servlet container. It comes with a small embedded HTTP server.
TODO: move most of the logic from the server side to the client side

Usage:

// The HTTP port.
int port = ...;
// Max history of metrics values to keep 
int maxItems = ...;
MetricsDashboard dashboard = new MetricsDashboard(port, maxItems);
